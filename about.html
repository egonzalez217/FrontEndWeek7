    <p style="width: 50%; font-family: sans-serif">
      Our teslas are some of the best electric vehicles out on the road today.
      Though the design of the chassis of the car can be polarising to some, it
      is a look that many have become familliar with while they are driving on
      the road

      What makes Teslas different from the rest
    </h2>
    <p style="width: 50%; font-family: sans-serif">
      Despite many car manufactures attemtping to create hybrid or fully
      electric options amongst their lineups of combustion engine vehicles,
      Tesla's are some fo the first fully electric vehicles to emerge and
      operate to a highly efficient degree. Though the electric vehicle scene
      has grown since Tesla's initial inception, our vehicles still harbour some
      of the best charge capacities available even in our most affordable
      vehicles.
